bi8wnhce5hjd7qbkh587hw25l5polgnt,"A - already no ""wood to metal"" sound. Middle was a bit muddy. B - better for the middle bit. Can hear the vocal harmonies, middle instruments etc.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p3
lt601o74ixkhkj4lzjh2s2k5mctns54h,"A - really nice balance but kick could do with coming down a bit, feel like in general it's too upfront in the mix both level and frequency wise. Vocals are sitting nice in the mix, consistently there. Selected - Kick feels a little bit thin, but works in the more stripped back sections, pokes out in the mix when the elements all play, Vocals don't seem to be as present and getting masked by the guitars, but overall much nicer balance.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p3

9muwh3ur2ms2k1wnhubi1n2b47yygj8k,"Kick drum more present in the second one. Seemed to be more space on the selected one, other one everything was bunched together.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p3
rw4oua9rip2ucujlfmxan74iz0cfab5g,"B sounded brighter overall, fit the music better. A guitars kind of got lost, didn't come through as much as in second one.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p3
o7u4f0y6ueshkwxo127lzbzx1az654ny,Guitars sat a lot better in selected one. first one vocals felt like they were on their own.,DevilsWords_no_eq_p3
