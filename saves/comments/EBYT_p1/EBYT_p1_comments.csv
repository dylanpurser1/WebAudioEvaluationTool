bi8wnhce5hjd7qbkh587hw25l5polgnt,"A - band is at the forefront again. Can't hear singer in the last section. B - High accented notes in the voice is too loud at the end, but beter overall.",EBYT_fyp_mix_p1
lt601o74ixkhkj4lzjh2s2k5mctns54h,"Top end of snare in A (maybe 6k) seemed a little bit too grating, quite brittle. selected more low mids in snare, guitar doesn't cut as much, maybe a reduced amount of topend, vocals cut through a lot more, cymbals stick out too much for taste.
Other than crash at end selected is preferred",EBYT_fyp_mix_p1
8sqn5b0nyc2jv91n3vkgud8fphmczft4,"Loads of warmth in bass, more mids, treble isn't as much. Feels more full.",EBYT_fyp_mix_p1

rw4oua9rip2ucujlfmxan74iz0cfab5g,"First one was quite muddy, didn't have as good seperation in A compared to B. Cymbals felt brighter in B, vocals more prominent.",EBYT_no_eq_p1
o7u4f0y6ueshkwxo127lzbzx1az654ny,"Didn't really like either of them with the vocals. Agreed with brightness in vocals but that's because of everything else taking those ranges instead, made the cymbals hit harder.",EBYT_no_eq_p1
c4zm85wbbgwfsyf63lzyydbtldjcxrfz,B was a lot more balanced. Not much driving low end in A.,EBYT_fyp_mix_p1
