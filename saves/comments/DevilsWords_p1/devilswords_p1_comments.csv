bi8wnhce5hjd7qbkh587hw25l5polgnt,"Voice is much louder compared to harms and band in A. Chorus a tiny bit better but bc of loudness in A. Sounds a bit muddy in B, one extreme to the other (this seemed better in the chorus).",DevilsWords_fyp_mix_p1
lt601o74ixkhkj4lzjh2s2k5mctns54h,"A - bass is way too overpowering, has a lot of lowend but if had 1-2kHz it would cut through better, bass is overpowering guitars, not much seperation. Selected - snare instantly a lot thinner, but guitar and bass go together a lot more, like the top end on the kick, vocal has more topend which helps it cut through the mid heavy mix.",DevilsWords_fyp_mix_p1

rw4oua9rip2ucujlfmxan74iz0cfab5g,"A kick got completely lost with the bass, no high end with kick. B was much clearer on that front. Vocals in B didn't like EQ, sounded really scooped around the mids.",DevilsWords_fyp_mix_p1
