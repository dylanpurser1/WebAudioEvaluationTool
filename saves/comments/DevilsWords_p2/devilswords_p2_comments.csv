bi8wnhce5hjd7qbkh587hw25l5polgnt,"A - nice mix between the bass. Wasn't noticing bad frequencies in this. B - feels a bit sharper. ""Cymbals are very... there"". Lots more presence of hats + crashes, but could hear bass. A little bit much at first.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
lt601o74ixkhkj4lzjh2s2k5mctns54h,"A - Too much low mid around 250-300Hz on kick, boxy, overpowers everything, most part vocals are quite upfront but were times it got lost which it doesn't need in a song like that. Selecter - EQ is pushing bass too far forward in the mix, vocals are more upfront but a little too nasaly.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
8sqn5b0nyc2jv91n3vkgud8fphmczft4,Way too much bass (B). A much quieter but mix (apart from kick) better. A is unmixed and B is just a shit mix. Way too much lowend.,DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
f2nrem6sa71z0v5th10kmf29tz1dsldo,"Selected had a lot more excitement, but also had a lot more wooliness in the lowend - below 200Hz had a real lack of clarity, was worse in B than A, but A felt really flat in the high mids upwards. Felt very different.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
0aqdvgro7qjjc7hkhn60m7xjwx5yoqvo,"Both were bad. A was slightly less bad but you could hear a low bass boost, over B which had a low mid boost. kick sounded too punchy in A over the whole mix sounding too muddy in B.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
nz2ae3ljcdcc0gi1c71wwmf9uiolr9tp,"Guitars feel fuller in the selected, has a bit more clarity. In opposite kick is the only thing that comes through good, everything else lacks clarity.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
9muwh3ur2ms2k1wnhubi1n2b47yygj8k,"Mostly same reasons for decision as last time, vocals were turned up though and noticed backing vocals.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
rw4oua9rip2ucujlfmxan74iz0cfab5g,"A kick sounded too loud. Couldn't hear guitars as well in A. B could've had more high end for the vocals, sounded a little murky, but overall much preferred.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
o7u4f0y6ueshkwxo127lzbzx1az654ny,"Guitars were a lot more present in selected one, drums and bass were in your face in opposite choice. Both toms felt really quiet.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
c4zm85wbbgwfsyf63lzyydbtldjcxrfz,"Not keen on both. A was a tiny bit muddier, but both had problems in the low end.",DevilsWords_no_eq_p2
