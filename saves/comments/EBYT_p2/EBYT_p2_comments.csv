lt601o74ixkhkj4lzjh2s2k5mctns54h,"A with bass not as much sub harmonic frequencies, snare a lot more plesant, slight sibilance. opposite - No bass compared to A, feels like 100Hz and below is gone, feel like kick is getting masked by the bass a lot, frequency of the kick attack is similar to bass pluck attack, EQ curve for vocals makes it sit better in the last section.",EBYT_fyp_mix_p2

rw4oua9rip2ucujlfmxan74iz0cfab5g,"A sounded really good mix wise, but in second part it didn't sound as good. Keys in the mix at that part were too loud bot overall was the best sounding one.",EBYT_fyp_mix_p2
o7u4f0y6ueshkwxo127lzbzx1az654ny,"Selected more balance, felt like there was a hole in the mids in the opposite one.",EBYT_fyp_mix_p2
c4zm85wbbgwfsyf63lzyydbtldjcxrfz,Slightly B. Mad how different parts can change in level just from EQ. Maybe B was a little tighter. Was difficult to pick.,EBYT_fyp_mix_p2
